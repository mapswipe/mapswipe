# This script updates version and build numbers as needed for both
# Android and iOS build systems.
# This replaces the default `yarn version` script, which does not handle
# build numbers as needed for iOS deployments.

# The resulting git tags will look like:
# v1.3.38(4)-beta where
# 1.3.38 is a semver version number
# 4 is the build number
# all numbers above must be between 0 and 99, or the system will fail somewhere
# -beta is only added to beta/dev builds, the production build has no extension

# On android, the build.grade script will build a globally unique build number to satisfy
# the playstore's requirements.
# This script must be run locally (not on github actions) to release a new version.

# stop immediately if we encounter any error
set -e
